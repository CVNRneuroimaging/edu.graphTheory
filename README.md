edu.graphTheory
================

CVNR imaging core members requested a primer on graph theory. This repository centralizes the supporting files and documentation.


DATED PROGRESS NOTES (recent to older):
==========================================

R, 20141002:
----------------
In lab meeting Stephen provided a self-test on basic graph theory terms and concepts. All items can be completed by watching one 90-minute video (provided). The pace at which PIs make time to complete the video and self-test will inform the depth and pace of further discussion.

R, 20140925:
----------------
In lab meeting the PIs (BC/KM/JN) agree that they want to arrive at some common baseline understanding of brain imaging methods that employ graph theory. Depth of that understanding was left TBD: more than just recognizing terms in methods sections, but less than being able to implement methods in matlab.
